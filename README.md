DotNetOpenAuth.WebAPI.40
========================
DotNetOpenAuth for ASP.NET WebAPI (OpenID/OAuth/OAuth2)


**Please note that this project is still in development and should be considered unstable-ish*


Purpose
------------

This project was developed to look into ways we can bring OAuth to the world of ASP.NET WebAPI.

Details
------------

I have included the following in the source

**source/DotNetOpenAuth.WebAPI**

- Code required for the magic to happen

**source/DotNetOpenAuth.WebAPI.ClientSample.MVC3**

- A sample client demonstrating communicating with a WebAPI resource via JavaScript as well as C#. Simply check/uncheck the checkbox to switch between the client modes

**DotNetOpenAuth.WebAPI.HostSample**

- A sample authorisation server and WebAPI host utilising the functionality exposed in DotNetOpenAuth.WebAPI

Feedback

As I mentioned earlier, this is just a functional stub i have put together tonight. It has not been fully tested as yet but as always feedback is always welcome.
