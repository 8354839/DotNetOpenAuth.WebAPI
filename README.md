DotNetOpenAuth.WebAPI.40
========================
DotNetOpenAuth for ASP.NET WebAPI (OpenID/OAuth/OAuth2)


**Please note that this project is still in development and should be considered unstable-ish*


Purpose
------------

This project was developed to look into ways we can bring OAuth to the world of ASP.NET WebAPI.

Details
------------

I have included the following in the source

**/[DotNetOpenAuth.WebAPI](https://github.com/DavidChristiansen/DotNetOpenAuth.WebAPI.40/tree/master/source/DotNetOpenAuth.WebAPI)**

- Code required for the magic to happen

**/[DotNetOpenAuth.WebAPI.ClientSample.MVC3](https://github.com/DavidChristiansen/DotNetOpenAuth.WebAPI.40/tree/master/source/DotNetOpenAuth.WebAPI.ClientSample.MVC3)**

- A sample client demonstrating communicating with a WebAPI resource via JavaScript as well as C#. Simply check/uncheck the checkbox to switch between the client modes

**/[DotNetOpenAuth.WebAPI.HostSample](https://github.com/DavidChristiansen/DotNetOpenAuth.WebAPI.40/tree/master/source/DotNetOpenAuth.WebAPI.HostSample)**

- A sample authorisation server and WebAPI host utilising the functionality exposed in DotNetOpenAuth.WebAPI

Feedback
--

As I mentioned earlier, this is still 'work in progress' but nevertheless a functional stub that I have put together. It has not been fully tested as yet. As always feedback is always welcome.
